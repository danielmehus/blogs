# Remember Baudrillard?

**Prompt / question I’m answering**

> ("[P]erhaps more than any other contemporary writer [Baudrillard] confronts the exhaustion of many of the guiding assumptions and beliefs that held critical thought together in the post-war period.")

**My 500-word response**

Tldr: Rojek and Turner discuss Baudrillard's reception as a thinker whose work is equal parts absurd and invaluable for sociology, philosophy, and cultural theory.

Jean Baudrillard (1929-2007) is the Cheshire Cat of the 21st century. Nearly twenty years after his death, his disembodied grin persists as his declarations about the world we live in continue to come into fruition.
Baudrillard may only be second to Zizek or Derrida when it comes to being a magnet of adoration and ire. Those who read him closely are aware of his genius and his absurdity. This is brought to the fore by Chris Rojek and Bryan S. Turner, the editors of a series of essays gathered and titled "Forget Baudrillard?"
As a sociologist, philosopher, and cultural theorist, Baudrillard colored outside the lines; the subject matter which he addresses requires readers to push their abilities to conduct conceptual abstraction to the limit. His style, however, sets him apart even moreso.
We see Baudrillard at his most lucid in his works such as "The Mirror of Production" where he brilliantly maneuvers through traditional Marxist theories of labor and delivers immanent critique so thorough that a sound rebuttal feels impossible. Surgical precision is required to cut open the fascia of a tradition he was dyed in. He does not disappoint.
On the other end of the spectrum we see his collection aptly titled "Cool Memories," where distinctions between prose, poetry, coherence, and incoherence disintegrate. Language, put simply, is pushed to its limits in Baudrillard.
This in tandem with fragile objects of study such as hyperreality, simulacra, symbolic exchange, seduction, and fatalism produce a body of work that is equal parts maligned and adored.

This is the sentiment echoed by Rojek and Turner in their introduction to "Forget Baudrillard?" Readers of Baudrillard are left with an inheritance that is trash or treasure depending on what one is looking for. I would make a case for this inheritance to be treasure.
The first World War brought the beginning and ending of modernity. Mass annihilation of people, dreams, and potentialities was proof that industrial advances do not guarantee progress. Artistic movements responded by coming to terms with the death of meaning.
Baudrillard does not address the death of meaning proper but rather the death of reality and representation. A death knell to the idea that the building blocks of the world itself, let alone meaning, are not substantial in any significant way. One can nit-pick about the exact nature of this claim, but it is rather representative of the mood. Accuracy, after all, is not what Baudrillard aimed for.
Most everyone has a hunch that things are not what they seem. Even moreso, most everyone has a hunch that things are not what they should be. Baudrillard's explication of the former is second to none. To address the latter properly, one should engage with the former.
In times where intellectual posturing reigns supreme, Baudrillard shows us the value of wading through the muck and the mire. Accuracy and consistency are shelved in favor of playfulness.
Forget Baudrillard? Perhaps the cat. Remember Baudrillard? He hasn't left yet; at least the grin remains.
